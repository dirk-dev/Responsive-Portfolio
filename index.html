      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img class="headshot" src="assets/images/dirk_avatar.jpg" alt="Dirk KIesewetter" style="width:250px">

      <p>I attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where I earned a B.A. in Journalism.
        I have worked as a prepress technician in the commercial printing industry for
        over 20 years, and have gained much experience working with design apps such as
        Adobe InDesign,Illustrator, and Photoshop, as well as specialized software such
        as PDF editors, RIPs, and press sheet layout software. </p>
    <p> I have been wanting to get into computer programming for some time, and
        am excited about the opportunity for me to become a web developer.
    </p>
    <p>I live in the Pittsburgh area with my wonderful wife and our rambunctious
        Siberian Husky. I enjoy sci-fi movies, astronomy, hiking, and traveling with my
        wife.
